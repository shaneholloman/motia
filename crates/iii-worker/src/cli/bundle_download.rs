//! Bundle worker install pipeline.
//!
//! A bundle worker is a tar.gz archive that contains a packaged
//! local-worker directory (an `iii.worker.yaml` manifest plus the
//! bundled application source). The engine resolves the worker via the
//! registry, downloads the archive over HTTPS, verifies its SHA-256,
//! extracts it atomically into `~/.iii/workers-bundle/{name}/`, and
//! then dispatches it through the existing libkrun rails used by
//! local-path workers.
//!
//! Boundary versus the OCI extract path:
//! - `worker_manager::oci::extract_layer_with_limits` is sized for OCI
//!   layers (up to 10 GiB / 1 M entries) and does NOT explicitly reject
//!   symlink/hardlink entries. Bundle workers are publish-time-built
//!   single-binary artifacts; nothing legitimate inside one is a
//!   symlink. We therefore use a dedicated, tighter extractor that
//!   accepts only `Regular` and `Directory` tar entry types and caps
//!   archive size, file count, and path depth aggressively. See
//!   `extract_bundle_safely` for the policy.
//!
//! Atomicity model:
//! - All work happens inside `~/.iii/workers-bundle/.staging/<rand>/`.
//! - A `StagingGuard` holds the fslock for `<name>` and owns the staging
//!   directory. The guard's `Drop` impl removes the staging directory
//!   unless `commit()` has been called. The lock outlives the staging
//!   directory (LIFO drop order), preventing a sibling install from
//!   slipping into a partially-cleaned-up state.
//! - The final step is an atomic `std::fs::rename` from the staging dir
//!   to `~/.iii/workers-bundle/{name}/`. Cross-filesystem renames fall
//!   back to copy-then-delete. A previous install of the same name is
//!   parked aside as a `{name}.old.<unique>` sibling first and restored
//!   if the new install fails (see `atomic_install`).
//!
//! Process-restart safety:
//! - The `Drop` guard cannot run if the process is killed mid-install.
//! - `sweep_orphans()` runs at engine/CLI startup and removes any
//!   leftover staging directories. See T18.
//! - `{name}.old.*` siblings leaked by a replacement that crashed
//!   between rename-aside and cleanup are swept on the next SUCCESSFUL
//!   install of the same worker (`sweep_stale_old_siblings`) — never
//!   before, since a parked sibling with no `final_dir` is the only
//!   remaining copy of the worker.

//! `iii worker status` — inspect what's happening to a worker without
//! context-switching to the engine terminal.
//!
//! Probes filesystem state (config.yaml entry, managed dir, prepared marker,
//! pid file, logs freshness) and the engine's TCP port, then renders a
//! human-readable snapshot. Supports `--watch` for a refreshing live view and
//! is also the primitive that powers `iii worker add --wait`.

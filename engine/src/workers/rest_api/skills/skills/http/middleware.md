# When to use

Register a middleware function when the same logic must run before **multiple** route handlers — authentication, rate limiting, request logging, header normalization, IP allow-listing. Middleware sits between the worker's body parser and the handler; it inspects the request and either lets it proceed (with optional `context` enrichment) or short-circuits with an immediate response.

| Question                                                                              | Use this                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Should this run on **every** matched HTTP route?                                      | Global middleware (configured in `iii-config.yaml` → `middleware:`) |
| Should this run only on a specific subset of routes?                                  | Per-route middleware (`middleware_function_ids` on the trigger)     |
| Is the function the route's actual response logic, not a precondition?                | The handler itself — see [Expose a function as an HTTP endpoint](iii://iii-http/http/reactive-triggers) |
| Should it gate firing without supplying its own response?                             | The trigger's `condition_function_id` (returns truthy/falsy only)  |

Reach for it when:

- You need to enforce auth across many endpoints — register one auth middleware globally and have it short-circuit on missing/invalid bearer tokens.
- You want to attach a per-request value (verified user, tenant id, request id) to `context` so handlers receive it without re-parsing the request.
- You need rate-limiting or request-size accounting that runs uniformly without each handler having to call into a shared library.

# Inputs

A middleware is just a regular registered function whose function id is referenced by config. Two registration paths target it at routes:

## Global middleware

Configure on the worker in `iii-config.yaml`. Runs on **every** matching HTTP route, sorted by `priority` ascending (lower priority runs first).

```yaml
- name: iii-http
  config:
    middleware:
      - function_id: "global::rate-limiter"          # required. Function id of the middleware to invoke.
        phase: preHandler                            # optional. Currently only "preHandler" is supported. Defaults to "preHandler".
        priority: 5                                  # optional. Execution order, lower runs first. Defaults to 0.
      - function_id: "global::auth"
        phase: preHandler
        priority: 10
```

## Per-route middleware

Set `middleware_function_ids` on the `http` trigger config. Runs **after** the global chain, in array order.

```json
{
  "type":        "http",
  "function_id": "api::get-admin-data",
  "config": {
    "api_path":                "/admin/data",
    "http_method":             "GET",
    "middleware_function_ids": ["auth::require-admin", "audit::log-access"]   // invoked in order; either may short-circuit before the handler runs
  }
}
```

The full preHandler chain executes in this order on every request:

1. Route match (against `api_path` + `http_method`).
2. Global middleware (sorted by `priority` ascending).
3. Route condition (the trigger's optional `condition_function_id`).
4. Per-route middleware (in `middleware_function_ids` array order).
5. Body parsing.
6. Handler function.

Any middleware can stop the chain by returning `{ action: "respond", ... }`; subsequent middleware and the handler are skipped.

# Outputs

The middleware function receives a **subset** of the `HttpRequest` — body is omitted because middleware runs before body parsing:

```json
{
  "path":         "/users/123",                       // request path
  "method":       "GET",                              // HTTP method
  "path_params":  { "id": "123" },                    // path variables from :name segments
  "query_params": { "fields": "name,email" },         // query string
  "headers":      { "authorization": "Bearer ...", "content-type": "application/json" }  // request headers (lowercased keys)
}
```

The middleware must return one of two shapes:

```json
// Continue: pass control to the next middleware (or the handler when this is the last one).
{
  "action":  "continue",
  "context": { "user_id": "u_123", "scopes": ["read", "write"] }   // optional. Merged into HttpRequest.context for downstream middleware and the handler.
}
```

```json
// Respond: short-circuit with an immediate HTTP response. Subsequent middleware and the handler do not run.
{
  "action":   "respond",
  "response": {                                       // The same shape an HTTP handler returns — see "Outputs" in the http trigger how-to for full rules.
    "status_code": 401,
    "headers":     { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    "body":        { "error": "missing_or_invalid_bearer" }
  }
}
```

- `action` is required and must be exactly `"continue"` or `"respond"`. Any other value (including a missing `action` field) is treated as an error and short-circuits the request with a 500.
- On `"continue"`, the optional `context` field is shallow-merged into `HttpRequest.context`; later middleware can read or extend it; the handler sees the final accumulated object.
- On `"respond"`, the `response` object follows the same `HttpResponse` rules as a regular handler — `status_code` defaults to 200 if omitted, headers can be object or array form, and Content-Type drives body serialization.

# Worked example

The typical pattern is one middleware function per cross-cutting concern, wired up either globally or per-route:

- **Global auth.** Register an auth middleware whose function id is in the global `middleware:` list with `phase: preHandler`. It inspects `headers.authorization`, returns `{ action: "respond", response: { status_code: 401, ... } }` on missing/invalid tokens, or `{ action: "continue", context: { user_id, scopes } }` on success — every handler then receives `HttpRequest.context.user_id` without parsing the header itself.
- **Per-route admin gate.** On routes that need elevated privilege, set `middleware_function_ids: ["auth::require-admin"]`. The route condition (`condition_function_id`) is the right place for cheap boolean checks; middleware is the right place when you need to enrich `context` or return a structured error response.
- **Logging + rate-limit chain.** Stack multiple middleware globally with explicit priorities (`priority: 5` for rate-limit before `priority: 10` for auth), so the cheaper check runs first and rejects 429s before authentication work happens.

# iii

iii is a WebSocket-routed worker mesh. One engine process (default port `49134`) holds a live registry of every connected worker, every function those workers expose, and every trigger bound to them. Workers are independent processes that open a WebSocket to the engine and register **Functions** (`service::name` handlers) and **Triggers** (events that invoke those functions). There is no direct worker-to-worker traffic — every call routes through the engine.

This registry worker documents the **`engine::*`** introspection surface (implemented in-process) and the **`worker::*`** lifecycle ops (implemented by the `iii-worker-ops` sidecar). It is always present in the engine and is not configured in `config.yaml`.

This worker is built into the engine and is always available; no install step is needed.

## Registry name vs runtime name

| Surface | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Registry / manifest | **`iii`** | [`iii.worker.yaml`](iii.worker.yaml) `name:` field |
| Engine runtime worker (in-process) | **`iii-engine-functions`** | Mandatory builtin; owns `engine::*` |
| `engine::functions::list` owner for `engine::*` | **`iii-engine-functions`** | Until runtime name aligns with registry |
| `worker::*` owner | **`iii-worker-ops`** | Sidecar daemon; not in-process |

Use `engine::workers::info { name: "iii-engine-functions" }` (not `"iii"`) for full introspection of the in-process surface today. Filter with `engine::functions::list { prefix: "engine::", include_internal: true }` to list `engine::*` handlers without needing the worker name.

## Architecture

| Primitive | What it is |
|---|---|
| Engine | One coordinator process. Routes every invocation. |
| Worker | A process that opens a WebSocket to the engine. |
| Function | A named handler inside a worker, id `service::name`. |
| Trigger | A `(type, config, function_id)` triple that causes a function to run when an event fires. |

Every call is `caller → engine → handler`. The function id is the only contract between any two workers.

## Functions — `engine::*`

Implemented in-process by mandatory worker **`iii-engine-functions`**. Filter lists with `prefix`, `search`, or `worker`. By default, `engine::functions::list`, `engine::triggers::list`, and `engine::registered-triggers::list` hide internal `engine::*` rows unless `include_internal: true`.

For exact request/response JSON Schemas, call `engine::functions::info { function_id: "engine::…" }`.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `engine::channels::create` | Create a streaming channel pair (writer + reader refs). |
| `engine::functions::list` | List registered functions with their owning worker name. |
| `engine::functions::info` | Inspect one function: schemas, owner, and registered triggers. |
| `engine::triggers::list` | List trigger types registered with the engine. |
| `engine::triggers::info` | Inspect one trigger type: schemas, owner, and live instance count. |
| `engine::registered-triggers::list` | List registered trigger instances (subscriber rows). |
| `engine::registered-triggers::info` | Inspect one registered trigger with denormalized trigger and function detail. |
| `engine::workers::list` | List workers connected to the engine (WebSocket-connected only). |
| `engine::workers::info` | Inspect one connected worker's full surface (functions, trigger types, registered triggers). |
| `engine::workers::register` | Register worker metadata (called by SDK workers on connect). |

### `engine::functions::list` filters

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `prefix` | string | Exact prefix match on `function_id`. |
| `search` | string | Case-insensitive substring on `function_id` and `description`. |
| `worker` | string | Exact worker-name match. |
| `include_internal` | boolean | Include `engine::*` rows. Defaults to `false`. |

## Functions — `worker::*`

Implemented by sidecar **`iii-worker-ops`** (auto-injected daemon). Each op is also available as `iii worker <cmd>` on the CLI. In `engine::functions::list`, these appear under worker name **`iii-worker-ops`**, not `iii`.

For exact parameter and response shapes, call `engine::functions::info { function_id: "worker::add" }` or `worker::schema { function_id: "worker::add" }`.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `worker::add` | Install a worker from registry or OCI; writes `iii.config.yaml`, caches under `~/.iii/managed/{name}/`, pins `iii.lock`. |
| `worker::remove` | Drop a worker's config entry. Leaves cached artifacts on disk — pair with `worker::clear` to reclaim space. Requires `yes: true`. |
| `worker::update` | Re-pin registry workers to latest semver and rewrite `iii.lock`. OCI-sourced workers are skipped. |
| `worker::start` | Spawn a configured worker. Default `wait: true` blocks until the engine sees the WS handshake. |
| `worker::stop` | Graceful shutdown. Requires `yes: true`. Does not touch config, lock, or cache. |
| `worker::list` | Union of config entries, managed artifacts, and running processes. Includes daemon-managed builtins. |
| `worker::clear` | Delete cached artifacts under `~/.iii/managed/{name}/`. Requires `yes: true`. Does not touch config or lock. |
| `worker::schema` | JSON Schemas for every op plus `default_timeout_ms` and `idempotent` hints. |

> **Note:** `worker::add` with `source.kind: "local"` works on the CLI only (returns **W102** via the trigger surface). Destructive ops (`remove`, `stop`, `clear`) require `yes: true` (boolean, not string).

Merge `worker::list` with `engine::workers::list` by `name` for a complete worker picture — daemon-managed providers such as `iii-http` may not appear in `engine::workers::list` even when serving traffic.

## Trigger types

### Reactive — owned by `iii-engine-functions`

| Trigger type | Description |
|---|---|
| `engine::functions-available` | Fires when the function registry changes (polled every 5s). Payload includes `event: "functions_changed"` and the current function list. |
| `engine::workers-available` | Fires when worker metadata is updated via `engine::workers::register`. |

### Custom — owned by `iii-worker-ops`

| Trigger type | Description |
|---|---|
| `worker` | Worker lifecycle events emitted by every `worker::*` op. Subscribe with `operations` / `stages` / `workers` filters. |

## Before you build

Run these reads before authoring a new worker — the capability you need may already exist:

1. `engine::functions::list` — every function on this engine (filter with `prefix` or `search`).
2. `directory::registry::workers::list` — every worker in the public registry. Prefer `worker::add { source: { kind: "registry", name: "…" } }` over re-implementing.

Only hand-author a worker when both come up empty.

## Canonical trigger types (other workers)

Pass these literal strings as `type` in `registerTrigger`. Provider READMEs on the registry are authoritative when versions drift.

| `type` | Provider | Config keys |
|---|---|---|
| `http` | `iii-http` | `{ http_method, api_path }` |
| `cron` | `iii-cron` | `{ expression }` — 7 fields: sec min hr dom mon dow year |
| `queue` | `iii-queue` | `{ queue, retries }` |
| `state` | `iii-state` | `{ scope, condition_function_id }` |
| `stream` | `iii-stream` | `{ stream_name }` |
